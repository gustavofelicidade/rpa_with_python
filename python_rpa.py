# Some useful RPA Tools


''' This Method Create an executable file with the processes that you've recorded.

Just visit the following repository and following the README.md instructions you can install all the requirements and
start to automate boring stuff easily with python:

    Literally Automate the boring stuff with Python,
    allows the user to record his mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce them identically
as many times as he wants.

    # RPA for Python

    '''     Previously dubbed “TagUI for Python,” this is a Python package for RPA development. 
        (The rationale for the name change is wonderfully straightforward and geeky, too.) 
        RPA for Python was built on TagUI, hence the original name. 
        It boasts website automation, computer vision automation, optical character recognition, 
        and keyboard-and-mouse automation as its fundamental capabilities.    '''
